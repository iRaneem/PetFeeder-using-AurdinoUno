# objective & motivation 
Make mealtimes easier and more fun for you and your cat with one of the great cat feeders. it detects the pet near the food bowl and allows desired quantity of food to them. Automatic cat feeders that take the work out of feeding your cat whenever it is hungry. 
You can go out, sleep, shower, and farther more 
without worrying about your cat being hungry.
# Components Used: 
1- Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It contains 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power connector, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
2-Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object using sonar. This sensor has a range of 2cm to 400cm (0.8inch to 157inch) with an accuracy of 0.3cm (0.1inch), making it suitable for most hobbyist projects.
3-Servo motor SG90
Servo motors are great devices for turning to a certain position. Usually, they have a servo arm that can turn 180 degrees. We can use the Arduino to direct a servo to a specific location, and it will do so.
4-Connecting Wires 
wires are used for making connections between items and your Arduino's header pins.
#How to Use 
first downlod aurdoino software and uplod the code to the IDE
second you should do the connection of hardware as in the presentation 
conecct the PC to Ardoino chip through USB be aware to specify the port from the bar tool in the IDE
now evry thing is ready once cat is near enough ultrasonic sensor detect its presents and motor will rotate 90 degree allowing food to drop
